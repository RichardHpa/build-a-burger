# Build a Burger

Create a make your own burger application.  
Using jQuery UI, you are to design a application which will allow you to create your own burger, and then output the total price for your burger.

All the starting assets are on the student server, as well as an .ai file if you want to add more in later on.  
Each option should have a different price attached to it.

To start there are some constraints.
- You can only have 1 type of bun
- You can only have 1 type of meat
- You can only have 1 type of cheese
- You don't need to include all the salads.

Once you have finished, then you can extend it to allow you to have multiple types or meats or cheeses.  
If you would also like to add in more options you can, but please try and complete the main task first.
